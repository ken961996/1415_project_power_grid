Code to compute centralities of the nodes in the network

The raw network data was taken from GridKit (https://zenodo.org/record/47317#.WRUilmjytEY)
The data of the links was copied into a text file and inputted into the python code as an Edge List. 
We used the package SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project) to analyze the data and computed the degree, eigenvector, and PageRank centralities of each node in the network.
The results were outputted to separate CSV files for each centrality measure.
